##Equivalent Circulating Density of Drilling Mud

Engineering Calculation of Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) of Drilling Mud takes into consideration many variables. Script **ecd.py** is based on simplified method, as explained in the "Formulas and Calculations for Drilling, Production and Workover".

Although script had been tested against published examples and confirmed in practice few times, there is **NO WARANTY OF ANY KIND*.

###Usage

Even simple drill string, composed of only one size of drill pipe, will have **MINIMUM TWO (2) SEGMENTS** - one for drill pipe and it's total length and the other for drill collar and it's own total length. Keep that in mind.
True Vertical Depth is not necessary equal to total length of drill pipe and drill collar - think about directional drilling.

###NOTE

You are using this script on **YOUR OWN RISK**. It is not replacement for simulations run by well control companies.
